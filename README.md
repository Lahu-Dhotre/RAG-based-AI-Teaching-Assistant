This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI Teaching Assistant that enables students to interact with educational content using voice and text queries. The system supports video and audio uploads, where OpenAI Whisper is used to transcribe spoken content into text.

The transcribed text, along with curated study materials (PDFs, notes, and lecture content), is embedded and stored in a vector database. When a user asks a question, the assistant retrieves the most relevant context and generates accurate, syllabus-aligned responses using a large language model.

The assistant is designed to provide clear explanations, step-by-step answers, and concept clarification, making learning more interactive and accessible.
